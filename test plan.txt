Test scrop: Input seriel number and get the warranty result. 
Test environment: Chrome brwoser and the link is https://www.barco.com/eu-en/support/clickshare-extended-warranty/warranty

I will divide the testing scope into two parts. One is UI verification and the other is functaional verification.

A. For the UI part, I will verify if the user interface is correct in different languages. 

	1. Verify the display of the user interface in different languages, the "Get info" button should be translated to correct language. (For AT, you can see A_1.py)
		1-1. Check the UI layout when the language is 日本語. Expected result is "情報を入手". 
		1-2. Check the UI layout when the language is Koren. Expected result is "Get info".
		1-3. Check the UI layout when the language is Русский. Expected result is "Получить информацию"
		1-4. Check the UI layout when the language is 中文. Expected result is "获取信息"

	2. Change between two language. For example, change to 中文, and then change to English. The "Get info" button should translated correctly. (For AT, you can see A_2.py)
	
B. For functional verification, it will be divided to valid input and invalid input. 

	1. Valid input: (For AT, you can see B_1.py)
		1-1. Get info when the seriel number is valid. As the specified seriel number "1863552437", check the warranty result should be same as the expected result.  
		Warranty results for 1863552437,
